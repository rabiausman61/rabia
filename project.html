        The only source of blood is healthy volunteer donors. As cancer patients
        need blood transfusions during their treatment, at Shaukat Khanum
        Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Lahore and Peshawar, we
        need more than 65 bags of blood and blood components every day. One bag
        of blood can save more than one life.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Blood Donation</h2>
      <p><strong>Q.</strong> Who can donate blood?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Any healthy individual can donate blood. Before
        taking blood, some questions related to your health will be asked to
        make sure that you can donate blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>. Can I donate blood if I had jaundice previously?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. No, if you have a history of jaundice in the past,
        you need to be screened for hepatitis before donating blood.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Do I have enough blood in my body to donate?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Yes. The body contains 10 to 12 pints of blood.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. How much blood is taken?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. For a whole blood donation, approximately one pint
        (which weighs about one pound-up to 500 ml) is collected.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. How often can I donate?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. The interval between blood donations should be at
        least 8 weeks.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Is there anything I should do before I donate?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Be sure to eat well at your regular mealtimes and
        drink plenty of fluids.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Will donating blood hurt?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. No more than a pinch in the beginning!  Our
        skilled phlebotomists make donating blood as painless and comfortable as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>. Can I develop infections like hepatitis or HIV (AIDS
        Virus) when I donate blood?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. No each blood bag and its needle are sterile and
        disposable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>. How much time does it take for my body to replace
        the blood that I donated?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Not long at all. The volume of fluids will adjust
        within a few hours of your donation.  The red blood cells will be
        replaced within a few weeks.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. What should I eat or drink after donation?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. You should drink plenty of fluids during the first
        few hours following the donation. As for food, you can have your own
        regular meals.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Can I smoke after donation?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Smoking is better avoided for at least 2 hours
        after donating blood because it may result in dizziness and a fainting
        attack.  Remember, smoking is dangerous to your health anyway!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>. What type of tests are performed on donated blood?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. After blood is drawn, it is tested for Blood
        Group, Hepatitis B &amp; C, HIV (AIDS Virus) and certain other
        infectious diseases to ensure the donor and the patient’s safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>. How long will my blood be stored for in the blood
        bank after collection?
      </p>
      <p>

        several components. Blood may be stored up to 35 days. However at

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Platelet Donation</h2>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. What are Platelets?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Platelets are blood cells that help control
        bleeding. When a blood vessel is damaged, platelets collect at the site
        of the injury and temporarily repair the tear. Platelets then activate
        substances in plasma which form a clot and allow the wound to heal.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. What is Apheresis?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Apheresis (ay-fur-ee-sis) is a special kind of
        blood donation that allows a donor to give specific blood components,
        such as platelets. We use the latest blood cell separators for this
        purpose. During the apheresis procedure, all except the needed blood
        component are returned to the donor.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Why is Blood Separated?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Different patients need different types of blood
        components, depending on their illness or injury. After you donate whole
        blood, the unit is separated into platelets, red cells and plasma in our
        Blood Bank.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Who Needs Platelets?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Many lifesaving medical treatments require
        platelet transfusions. Cancer patients, those receiving organ or marrow
        transplants, victims of traumatic injuries, and patients undergoing open
        heart surgery require platelet transfusions to survive. Because
        platelets can be stored for only five days, the need for platelet
        donation is huge and continuous.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Can I be an apheresis donor?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. If you meet the requirements for donating blood,
        you probably can give platelets. The interval between platelet donations
        should be at least 2 days and the donor should not undergo apheresis
        more than twice per week or more than 24 times in a year. You should not
        have taken aspirin or aspirin containing medicine within the last 72
        hours.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. Are apheresis donations safe?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Yes. Each donation is closely supervised
        throughout the procedure by our qualified and trained staff. Only a
        small percentage of your platelets are collected, so there is no risk of
        bleeding problems. Your body will replace the donated platelets within
        48 hours. The kits used are sterile and disposable.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. How does the procedure work?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. Blood is drawn from your arms through sterile
        tubing into the cell separator centrifuge. One line takes blood to the
        centrifuge; platelets are drawn up into a collection bag, while the
        remaining blood components (red cells and plasma) are returned to you
        simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. How long does it take?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. The entire apheresis donation process takes about
        60-90 minutes. You may watch television or listen to music, or simply
        sit back and relax while helping to save lives.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Q</strong>. How can I become an apheresis donor?</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans</strong>. To make an appointment, simply call the Blood Bank
        at SKMCH&amp;RC in Lahore at Tel: +92 42 35905000 Ext. 4326 or
        SKMCH&amp;RC in Peshawar at Tel: +92 91 588 5000 Ext. 4713.
